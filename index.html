            <p><img src="./images/jif_logo.png" alt="JIF Logo" id="jif-logo"><b>JIF</b> peanut butter is an iconic American brand with deep Kentucky roots. 
                    The story began in 1929 when Procter & Gamble opened a production facility in Lexington, Kentucky, developing the smooth, creamy peanut butter recipe that would become JIF. 
                    As the product gained nationwide popularity, JIF became synonymous with high-quality peanut butter, still manufactured in Kentucky to this day. 
                    Drawing on the state's agricultural heritage and skilled workforce, the JIF brand's origins in the Bluegrass State remain central 
                    to its enduring appeal, even as it is enjoyed by consumers worldwide.</p>
