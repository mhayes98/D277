Household:
    This includes the income of the householder and all other individuals 15 years old 
    and over in the household, whether they are related to the householder or not. 
    Because many households consist of only one person, average household income is usually less than average family income.

Capita: 
    Per capita income is the mean income computed for every man, woman, 
    and child in a particular group including those living in group quarters. 
    It is derived by dividing the aggregate income of a particular group by the total population in that group.
