            <h3>Seat of Kentucky</h3>
            <p>
                Nestled on the western edge of Kentucky's inner Bluegrass region, the city of Frankfort is a charming suburban community with a population of around 28,000 residents.
                Incorporated on February 28th, 1835, Frankfort has a rich history dating back to its founding as the state capital in 1792.
                The city's picturesque setting along the banks of the Kentucky River, surrounded by gently rolling hills, has long attracted visitors and new residents alike.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Small-Town Charm</h3>
            <p>
                As the seat of state government, Frankfort is home to the Kentucky State Capitol building and numerous other government offices.
                However, the city maintains a small-town feel, with a vibrant downtown district featuring locally-owned shops, restaurants, and cultural attractions.
                Frankfort's suburban character is exemplified by its quiet residential neighborhoods, well-maintained parks, and
                easy access to the natural beauty of the surrounding Bluegrass region.
            </p>

            <h3>Diverse Economy</h3>
            <p> 
                Despite its status as a government hub, Frankfort has a diverse economy that includes manufacturing, healthcare, and tourism.
                The city's proximity to larger metropolitan areas like Louisville and Lexington, combined with its affordable cost of living
                and high quality of life, make Frankfort an attractive option for those seeking a suburban alternative to Kentucky's urban centers.
